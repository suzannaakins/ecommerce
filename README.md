# E-Commerce Backend

## Description
This is the backend for an e-commerce site. It uses sequelize and mysql to create a database of products, tags, and categories. These items in the database are stored as models using sequelize.  I used sequelize again to create api routes to add, view all, view individually(by id), update, and delete items in the database. I used sequelize yet again to create associations between the models, such as one to many, and many to many. No big challenges.
